This plugin was made from scratch to use for APACHE free ERP : OFBiz
This is still work in progress.
At this point, we've worked mostly on references, to ease navigation toward services, labels, and entity definition.
There is also functionning references towards screens, forms, and menus definitions
In the future, we hope we'll ad many more cool features.
